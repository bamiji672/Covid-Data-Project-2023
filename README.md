# SQL-CODE
This is a project that seamlessly integrates SQL data extraction and Tableau visualization to provide an overview of the global landscape during and after COVID-19 period. I used SQL to extract tables, capturing important metrics such as total COVID-19 cases, deaths, death percentages, and the infection percentages showed the impact on total population health. 

The extracted data were then transformed into dashboards using Tableau, which enabled exploration of infection and mortality trends across continents, alongside a detailed analysis of daily progression and stringency indices. This project not only showcases technical proficiency in SQL and Tableau but also demonstrates a keen analytical approach to understanding and visualizing complex global health data.
